        <!-- Amish White Bread recipe from allrecipes.com -->
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>2/3 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>6 cups bread flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <!-- used <b> and <i> tags for visual markers of ingredients and times, no need for <strong> or <em> in this case -->
            
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve <b>sugar</b> in <b>warm water</b> in a large bowl, and then stir in <b>yeast</b>. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Mix <b>oil</b> and <b>salt</b> into the yeast. Mix in <b>flour</b> one cup at a time. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Place in a well-oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about <i>1 hour</i>.</li>

            <li>Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Shape into loaves, and place into two well-oiled 9x5-inch loaf pans. Allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch, about <i>30 minutes</i>.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Bake the risen loaves in the preheated oven until golden brown for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
